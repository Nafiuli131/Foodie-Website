Restaurant Management System is a web application displayed some delicious food stuffs
which can be used for ordering the foods, requesting home delivery, reserving the tables and
for the admin to confirm those orders and reservations. Lots of web application of this
domain have some limitations and failed to meet the customers and sellers demands. This
web application will attain the objectives of both customers and sellers which is exceedingly
user friendly, accommodative and comfortableto interact.In the last three months we’ve
finished the initial development of the project. The project has some future scope to work on.
Many traditional systems development methodologies are perceived as being inadequate for
dealing with the development of e-commerce systems. We’ve used the Internet commerce
development methodology (ICDM) because it considers evolutionary development of
systems, provides a business and strategic focus and includes a management structure in
addition to covering the engineering aspects of e-commerce application development. Using
this project, the customers as well as the sellers can be benefited since the processes are less
time consuming. In future, the project can be updated with the new technologies and
methodologies as needed. Obviousness will make the web application acceptable to all.
